# Waste Management App: Feature & Flow Specification

## Overview
This Flutter-based waste management app aims to facilitate proper garbage disposal by providing users with:
- Real-time map views of nearby waste collection, recycling, and waste bin centers.
- An image scanning feature that classifies waste items (e.g., recyclable, non-recyclable, biological, toxic) using the Gemini API.
- A chatbot interface for waste classification suggestions and follow-up inquiries.
- Reminders for waste dumping.
- A reporting mechanism for illegal dumping, which sends location-based details and images to the appropriate officials.

## Tech Stack
- **Front End:** Flutter  
- **Back End:** Firebase (for authentication, data storage, notifications, etc.)  
- **Maps:** OpenStreetMap  
- **Image Identification & Chatbot:** Gemini API  

## App Flow & Feature Details

### 1. Homepage UI & Navigation
#### 1.1. Map Component (Minimized View)
- **Display:** A small, rectangular minimap at the top of the homepage.
- **Content:** Shows nearby garbage collection centers, recycling stations, and waste bin locations.
- **Interaction:**  
  - **Tap Action:** On tapping the map, navigate to a dedicated map page.

#### 1.2. Full Map Page
- **Display:** An expanded map view.
- **Features:**
  - **User Location:** Displays the user's current location.
  - **Nearby Centers:** Marks nearby waste management centers with appropriate icons.
- **Implementation Considerations:**  
  - Use OpenStreetMap API integrations with Flutter map plugins.
  - Leverage Firebase (or location services) to update user's location in real-time.

### 2. Image Classification & Chatbot Interface
#### 2.1. Image Scanning Feature
- **Functionality:**  
  - Allow users to take or select images of waste.
  - Utilize Gemini API to analyze and classify the image.
- **Classification Output:**  
  - Classify waste as recyclable, non-recyclable, biological, or toxic.
  - Provide the name/description of the item if recognizable.
  
#### 2.2. Chatbot for Suggestions & Follow-up
- **Display:**  
  - Show the classification results within a chatbot-style interface.
  - Provide recycling suggestions where applicable.
- **User Interaction:**  
  - Users can ask follow-up questions regarding recycling processes, safe disposal methods, or additional tips.
- **Integration:**  
  - Gemini API is used not only for image recognition but also for generating context-aware suggestions.
  - The chatbot interface can be built using Flutter widgets and connected to Firebase to log conversations if needed.

### 3. Chat Option
- **Standalone Chat:**  
  - In addition to the image classification chatbot, offer a general chat option.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Enable users to ask questions about waste management, recycling tips, or other related queries.
- **Backend:**  
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging (or Realtime Database) can be used to store and manage chat histories.

### 4. Waste Dumping Reminder
- **Functionality:**  
  - Allow users to set reminders for when to dump their waste.
- **Features:**  
  - Schedule notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging or local notifications.
  - Optionally, integrate calendar functionalities for repeated reminders.
- **User Interface:**  
  - Simple UI component for setting time and frequency of reminders.

### 5. Illegal Dumping Reporting
- **Reporting Mechanism:**  
  - Provide an interface for users to report illegal dumping incidents.
- **Input Options:**  
  - Capture images related to the incident.
  - Use location services to automatically capture the current location.
  - Allow manual input for additional details (e.g., description, time, specific location notes).
- **Data Handling:**  
  - Upload report details and images to Firebase.
  - Optionally, integrate with third-party services or a dedicated reporting API to send notifications to local authorities.
- **User Feedback:**  
  - Confirm report submission and provide a status update if possible.

## Detailed App Flow

### A. User Journey

1. **Launch & Homepage:**
   - User opens the app and lands on the homepage.
   - A minimized rectangular map shows nearby centers.
   - Below the map, options for image scanning, chat, reminders, and reporting are visible.

2. **Map Interaction:**
   - **Minimap:** User sees a condensed view of nearby locations.
   - **Tap to Expand:** Tapping the map leads to the full map view.
   - **Full Map:** The user's current location is highlighted along with waste management centers.

3. **Image Scanning & Classification:**
   - **Access:** User selects the image scanning option.
   - **Process:** The app opens the camera/gallery.
   - **Processing:** The Gemini API processes the image and returns classification data.
   - **Display:** The results, along with recycling suggestions, are shown in a chatbot-like format.
   - **Follow-Up:** The user can ask further questions about the waste item.

4. **Chat Feature:**
   - **General Chat:** Users can interact with the chatbot for any waste management inquiries.
   - **Data Flow:** Chat history may be stored in Firebase for consistency and future reference.

5. **Waste Dump Reminder:**
   - **Setup:** User sets a reminder through the app interface.
   - **Notification:** The app sends notifications based on the set schedule using Firebase's notification services.

6. **Illegal Dumping Reporting:**
   - **Report Initiation:** User selects the report option.
   - **Inputs:** User captures a photo, confirms the location (via GPS), and adds details.
   - **Submission:** Report is sent to Firebase and optionally forwarded to local authorities.

### B. Technical Flow & Integration

- **Flutter Front End:**
  - Use Flutter widgets for UI components: maps, chat interfaces, image capture, and forms.
  - Leverage state management (e.g., Provider, Bloc) for smooth UI transitions and data handling.

- **Firebase Back End:**
  - **Authentication:** Secure login and user management.
  - **Database:** Store user data, chat logs, report submissions, and reminder settings.
  - **Cloud Messaging:** Handle notifications for reminders and report status updates.

- **OpenStreetMap Integration:**
  - Integrate using Flutter-compatible plugins.
  - Display markers and user location dynamically.
  
- **Gemini API Integration:**
  - Handle API requests for image classification.
  - Parse the response to determine waste type and fetch appropriate recycling suggestions.
  - Integrate chatbot responses for interactive guidance.

## Additional Considerations

- **User Experience:**
  - Ensure the UI is intuitive and accessible.
  - Optimize map interactions for responsiveness.
  - Provide clear feedback during API calls (loading states, error messages).

- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Secure API keys for Gemini API and Firebase.
  - Handle user data with appropriate permissions and privacy standards.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Robust error handling for network issues, API failures, and permission denials (especially for location and camera access).

- **Scalability:**
  - Design the Firebase database schema to handle growing data (chat logs, reports, reminders).
  - Modularize code for maintainability and future feature expansions.

## Conclusion
This document outlines a comprehensive flow and feature set for a Flutter-based waste management app. By integrating OpenStreetMap for location services, Gemini API for image classification and chatbot functionalities, and Firebase for back-end support, the app aims to provide an intuitive and functional experience for users in managing waste effectively. The structured approach ensures that developers can implement each feature modularly while maintaining a cohesive overall design.
